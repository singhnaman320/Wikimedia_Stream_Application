# Wikimedia_Stream_Application
This repository deals with the code base of wikimedia real-time application, which is a Spring Boot, Kafka integrated application. Here we will read live stream data from wikimedia using Kafka Producer and write it to the broker. Similarly, Kafka Consumer will consume the data from broker and write it to our database.
