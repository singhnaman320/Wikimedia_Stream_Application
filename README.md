# Wikimedia_Stream_Application
This repository deals with the code base of the Wikimedia multi-module real-time application, which is a Spring Boot, Kafka-integrated application. Here we will read live stream data from Wikimedia using Kafka Producer and write it to the broker. Similarly, Kafka Consumer will consume the data from a broker and write it to our database.
